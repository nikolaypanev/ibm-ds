# Python Program to Count words in a String using Dictionary
def freq(string,passedkey):

    #step1: A list variable is declared and initialized to an empty list.
    words = []

    #step2: Break the string into list of words
    words = string.split() # or string.lower().split()

    #step3: Declare a dictionary
    Dict = {}

    #step4: Use for loop to iterate words and values to the dictionary
    for key in words:
        if(key == passedkey):
            Dict[key] = words.count(key)   
    #step5: Print the dictionary
    print("Total Count:", Dict)

#step6: Call function and pass string in it
